The problem
You’re tasked with taking entries of personal information in multiple formats and normalizing each entry into a standard JSON format.

Input
Your program will be fed an input file of n lines. Each line contains “entry” information, which consists of a first name, last name, phone number, color, and zip code.
The order and format of these lines vary in three separate ways. The three acceptable formats are as follows:
Lastname, Firstname, (703)-742-0996, Blue, 10013 
Firstname Lastname, Red, 11237, 703 955 0373 
Firstname, Lastname, 10013, 646 111 0101, Green

A line is defined as invalid if it does not comply with one of the formats shown above. Invalid lines should not interfere with the processing of subsequent valid lines. A zip code is considered valid if it has 5 digits, and no other characters. A phone number is considered valid if it has 7, and only 7, digits. A phone number may have other non-numerical characters however, as shown shown above.
Output
The program should write a valid, formatted JSON object out to result.out. The JSON representation should be indented with two spaces. Within the JSON object should be a list named “entries”. The “entries” list should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order by (last name, first name).


Successfully processed lines should result in a normalized addition to the list associated with the “entries” key. For lines that were unable to be processed, a line number i (where 0 ≤ i < n) for each faulty line should be appended to the list associated with the “errors” key. The first line in the file is numbered 0.
Sample
For the input
Booker T., Washington, 87360, 373 781 7380, yellow 
Chandler, Kerri, (623)-668-9293, pink, 123123121 
James Murphy, yellow, 83880, 018 154 6474 asdfawefawea

We should receive the output
{
"entries": [
{
"color": "yellow",
"firstname": "James",
"lastname": "Murphy", "phonenumber": "018-154-6474", "zipcode": "83880"
}, {
"color": "yellow",
"firstname": "Booker T.", "lastname": "Washington", "phonenumber": "373-781-7380", "zipcode": "87360"
} ],
"errors": [ 1,
3 ]
}
